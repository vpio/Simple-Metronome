## Simple Metronome

Application 1/30 in my 30 app challenge.

### Run This Application
1. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/vpio/Simple-Metronome.git`
2. open `metronome.html` in your browser!

### Tone.js
* This is an amazing library that makes it easy to integrate audio into web development
* [Check out the repo here](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js)

#### Back to Basics
For the purpose of practice and education, this application was intentionally built with minimal dependencies (with the exception of the Tone.js library and Semantic-UI for styling).
